# Project Name: Loan Application Prediction Machine Learning
project we started with: Crime Forecasting via Machine Learning
    by county based on Age, Population Density, and Poverty.
    
Data Sources: 
    Census.Gov and Countyhealthrankings.org(FBI CrimeAPI)
    
Cleanup:
    1MM Crimes in Chicago in one decade with Geo Tags (local)
    3000+ Counties of Violent crimes across US (National)
    
Challenges that lead us to leave the project:
    Data set too large of an area to produce valuble statistics for Machine Learning.
    
Further Investigation:
    Provided with additional resources we could pull the FIPS(Census) Location tags based on the lon&lat location of crimes in Chicago and build a better model.
Take aways:
    

Main Project we worked on is Loan Prediciton Machine Learning modeling by Income, Gender, Location, Credit Status, Marital Status, Education, Loan Term and Loan Amount.

Project Intro/Objective:

Data Source:
    Kaggle.com: Loan Prediciton Application Data 

Cleanup:
    500 loans for predicitve models
    Binary Encoding, Numerical Encoding, DropNa,

Methods Used:
Inferential Statistics
Machine Learning
Data Visualization
Predictive Modeling
etc.

Technologies:
Python
Pandas, jupyter
HTML
JavaScript
etc.


Project Description:
(Provide more detailed overview of the project. Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing? Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

Challenges:
    Finding a solid data set, and Selecting machine learning models.

Further Investigation:
   Increasing data set, and Adding applicant Credit Score to the model.

Take Aways:
    Income, Credit History and Loan Amount were strongest correlation.
