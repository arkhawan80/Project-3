Project Name: Loan Application Prediction Machine Learning
Project Intro/Objective: 
Through this project, we try to develop multiple machine learning models to train and test the data set we use in the project and get the most accurate and usable outcome that would be practically beneficial for both businesses and public to predict eligibility and acceptance of loan applications.

Methods Used: 
o	Inferential Statistics

o	Machine Learning 


o	Data Visualization 

o	Predictive Modeling 


o	etc.

Technologies: 
o	Python 

o	Pandas, jupyter 


o	HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

o	 JavaScript


o	 Flask application

Project Description: 
•	The project is "Loan Prediction Machine Learning modeling" that counts eligibility to get accepted for a loan by Income, Gender, Location, Credit Status, Marital Status, Education, Loan Term and Loan Amount. 

•	Data Source: Kaggle.com: Loan Prediction Application 


•	Data Cleanup: 500 loans for predictive models Binary Encoding, Numerical Encoding, DropNa, 

•	Challenges: Finding a solid data set and selecting machine learning models. 


•	Further Investigation: Increasing data set and adding applicant credit score to the model.


Take Away and summary: 
o	Income, Credit History and Loan Amount were strongest correlation. 

o	Logistic regression is best model to predict loan prediction for the dataset. 


o	Using Confusion Matrix is focus point after creating logistic regression model that gave a practical usage of how businesses increase accuracy during validation process of loan to avoid mistakes. this project would help project managers to use this model as a risk management tool for their businesses.

•	Note: project we started with was "Crime Forecasting via Machine Learning" that predicted crimes by county based on Age, Population Density, and Poverty. Data Sources used is Census.Gov and Countyhealthrankings.org(FBI CrimeAPI) Cleanup process: 1MM Crimes in Chicago in one decade with Geo Tags (local) 3000+ Counties of Violent crimes across US (National) Challenges that lead us to leave the project: Data set too large of an area to produce valuable statistics for Machine Learning. Further Investigation: Provided with additional resources we could pull the FIPS(Census) Location tags based on the lon&lat location of crimes in Chicago and build a better model.
