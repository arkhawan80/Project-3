# Project-3
Crime Forecasting via Machine Learning
    by county based on Age, Population Density, and Poverty.
Data Sources: 
    Census.Gov and Countyhealthrankings.org(FBI CrimeAPI)
Cleanup:
    1MM Crimes in Chicago in one decade with Geo Tags (local)
    3000+ Counties of Violent crimes across US (National)
Challenges:
    Data set too large of an area to produce valuble statistics for Machine Learning.
Further Investigation:
    Provided with additional resources we could pull the FIPS(Census) Location tags based on the lon&lat location of crimes in Chicago and build a better model.
Take aways:
    

Loan Application Machine Learning modeling
    by Income, Gender, Location, Credit Status, Marital Status, Education, Loan Term and Loan Amount.
Data Source:
    Kaggle.com: Loan Prediciton Application Data 
Cleanup:
    500 loans for predicitve models
    Binary Encoding, Numerical Encoding, DropNa,
Challenges:
    Finding a solid data set, and Selecting machine learning models.
Further Investigation:
   Increasing data set, and Adding applicant Credit Score to the model.
Take Aways:
    Income, Credit History and Loan Amount were strongest correlation.
